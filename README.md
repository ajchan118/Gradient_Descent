# Gradient Descent
UC Berkeley Engineering 7 Intro to MATLAB Final Project Code. 

My take on the final project on optimization for UC Berkeley E7 class.  
The project is to find the nearest max/min/saddle point of the provided function, with some other details.

Inital file includes my initial attempt and ideas. It solves the problem correctly and succinctly with some extra bits to help the reader understand what is happening.

Final file includes some input from group members to make the code cleaner and straightforward. Also includes function input to make it easier to change the point of interest.
